      How much bandwidth you can allocate for the Storj network to use. 


      Be sure to leave enough bandwidth for other use cases you have for your
      internet connection and do not allocate more than your ISP supplied up
      and/or what your download speed can physically supply. To calculate the
      maximum monthly BANDWIDTH you can follow instructions
      [here](https://support.storj.io/hc/en-us/articles/360026893111-How-do-I-calculate-my-Total-monthly-bandwidth-from-my-Mbit-s-up-and-download-speed-).
      The minimum bandwidth requirement is 2TB.

  - title: Storage space
    description: >
      How much disk space you want to allocate to the Storj network.


      Be sure not to over-allocate space! Allow at least 10% extra for overhead.
      If you over-allocate space, you may corrupt your database when the system
      attempts to store pieces when no more physical space is actually available
      on your drive. The minimum storage shared requirement is 500 GB, which
      means you need a disk with at least 550 GB free to allow for the 10%
      overhead.
