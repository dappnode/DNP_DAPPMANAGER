      "description": "You must choose an installation method. Most users should choose the normal mode, but more advanced users will be able to customize the installation of the node and its environment variables. The methods are:\n\n**Normal** (recommended): You will sync and run an Ethereum full node. You will be able to broadcast transactions to the network and use it normally as your main node.\n\n**Archive** (NOT recommended): An Archive node downloads and stores every state. It is **NOT** recommended unless you want to query the node for very specific informatin or for research purposes. \n\n**Advanced** (NOT recommended): You will be able to select different parameters and configure them at will. Please refer to the [documentation](https://nethermind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) for further explanation.\n\n**Custom**: This mode needs a configuration file (.cfg) that will load particular settings. This allows you to use this client to set up a Goerli Archive node, an xDAi node and others. You can find examples of .cfg files in [Nethermind's github](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/tree/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Runner/configs).",
