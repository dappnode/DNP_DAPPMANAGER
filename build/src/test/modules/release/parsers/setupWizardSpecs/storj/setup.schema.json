  "description": "**Storj is a decentralized storage solution that pays you for your unused hard drive capacity and bandwidth in STORJ tokens! This wizard will help you install and configure a Storj node so you can start contributing and earning.**\n\nStorj is the name of the system for node operators. Its counterpart is [Tardigrade.io](https://tardigrade.io), a decentralized cloud for storage, where you should go if you're looking to store your data in a decentralized way! \n\n**How much will I earn?**\n\nIf you want to you check your potential earnings for V3 storage nodes check this [estimator](https://storj.io/storage-node-estimator/) made by the Storj team.\n\n**Hardware Requirements**\n\n*  One (1) processor core dedicated to each node service\n\n*  8 TB and a maximum of 24 TB of available space per node (Minimum of 500 GB with no maximum of available space per node)\n\n*  16+ TB of unmetered bandwidth available per month; unlimited preferred (Minimum of 2 TB of bandwidth available per month). \n\n**⚠️Warning: Storj can use up a lot of bandwidth! If you don't have an Unlimited plan it can eat up all your allocation and you might incur in charges by your Internet provider ⚠️**\n\n*  100 Mbps bandwidth upstream (Minimum of 5 Mbps bandwidth upstream)\n\n*  100 Mbps bandwidth downstream (Minimum of 25 Mbps bandwidth downstream)\n\n*  Uptime -online and operational- of 99.5% per month (Minimum uptime -online and operational- of 99.3% per month, max total downtime of 5 hours monthly)",
